<h3><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> is a system baselining and evidence collection tool.
The primary purpose of <strong>FTimes</strong> is to gather and/or develop
information about specified directories and files in a manner
conducive to intrusion analysis.</p>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> is a lightweight tool in the sense that it doesn't need
to be &quot;installed&quot; on a given system to work on that system, it is
small enough to fit on a single floppy, and it provides only a
command line interface.</p>
<p>Preserving records of all activity that occurs during a snapshot
is important for intrusion analysis and evidence admissibility.
For this reason, <strong>FTimes</strong> was designed to log four types of
information: configuration settings, progress indicators, metrics,
and errors.  Output produced by <strong>FTimes</strong> is delimited text, and
therefore, is easily assimilated by a wide variety of existing
tools.</p>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> basically implements two general capabilities: file
topography and string search.  File topography is the process of
mapping key attributes of directories and files on a given file
system.  String search is the process of digging through directories
and files on a given file system while looking for a specific
sequence of bytes.  Respectively, these capabilities are referred
to as map mode and dig mode.</p>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> supports two operating environments: workbench and
client-server.  In the workbench environment, the operator uses
<strong>FTimes</strong> to do things such as examine evidence (e.g., a disk image
or files from a compromised system), analyze snapshots for change,
search for files that have specific attributes, verify file integrity,
and so on.  In the client-server environment, the focus shifts from
what the operator can do locally to how the operator can efficiently
monitor, manage, and aggregate snapshot data for many hosts.  In
the client-server environment, the primary goal is to move collected
data from the host to a centralized system, known as an Integrity
Server, in a secure and authenticated fashion.  An Integrity Server
is a hardened system that has been configured to handle <strong>FTimes</strong>
GET, PING, and PUT HTTP/S requests.</p>
<p>The <strong>FTimes</strong> distribution contains a script called nph-ftimes.cgi
that may be used in conjunction with a Web server to implement a
public Integrity Server interface.  Deeper topics such as the
construction and internal mechanics of an Integrity Server are not
addressed in this document.</p>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> provides several modes of operation that either implement
its basic capabilities or support them in some way.  These modes
are described in the MODES OF OPERATION section of this document
and are outlined here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cfgtest - check config file syntax for a given file and mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compare - compare two map snapshots to detect change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decoder - decode a compressed map snapshot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>digauto - search for strings in files using a default configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>digfull - search for strings in files using a specified configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diglean - same as digfull except that the range of controls is limited and output can be written directly to std{err,out}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getmode - download a config file from an Integrity Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mapauto - collect directory and file attributes using a default configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mapfull - collect directory and file attributes using a specified configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maplean - same as mapfull except that the range of controls is limited and output can be written directly to std{err,out}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>version - display version information and exit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> also has many controls which dictate how it will execute.
Some modes support very few controls while others support quite a
few.  The following table summarizes what controls apply to each
mode of operation.  An 'X' indicates that the given control applies
to the selected mode.</p>

<h3><a name="modes_of_operation">MODES OF OPERATION</a></h3>
<p>The modes of operation described in this section are mutually
exclusive.  In other words, only one mode may be specified per
invocation.  Unless otherwise stated, the value for the <strong>baseline</strong>,
<strong>snapshot</strong>, and <strong>file</strong> arguments may be the name of a regular file
or '-'.  If the latter form is given, <strong>FTimes</strong> expects to read the
equivalent input from stdin.  Note, however, that the <strong>baseline</strong> and
<strong>snapshot</strong> arguments can not be '-' simultaneously.  The elements and
syntax rules of for all configuration files are described in the
CONFIGURATION CONTROLS section of this document.  The <strong>level</strong> option
is described in the OPTIONS section of this document.  The <strong>list</strong>
option specifies one or more directories, files, or symbolic links
that are to be scanned.  Collectively, these items represent an
<strong>Include</strong> list.  See the <strong>Include</strong> control for more information.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="cfgtest_file_mode_s" class="item"><strong>--cfgtest</strong> <strong>{file|-}</strong> <strong>mode</strong> <strong>[-s]</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Verify the syntax of a given configuration <strong>file</strong> in the context of a
specified <strong>mode</strong> where <strong>mode</strong> can be one of: <strong>digauto</strong>, <strong>digfull</strong>,
<strong>diglean</strong>, <strong>getmode</strong>, <strong>mapfull</strong>, or <strong>maplean</strong>.  The given
configuration <strong>file</strong> is parsed with the same methods that would be
used if <strong>FTimes</strong> had been invoked in that particular run <strong>mode</strong>.  By
default, directories and files are not checked for existence.  This
allows config files to be tested in a separate environment from where
they will be used.  Strict testing (i.e., directories and files must
exist) may be enabled with the <strong>-s</strong> option.</p>
<p>The value 'Syntax Passed' is written to stdout, if all syntax checks
are satisfied.  Otherwise, the value 'Syntax Failed' and a description
of the failure will be written to stdout.</p>
<p>Note: The fact that a given file passes all syntax checks does not
guarantee that its use will lead to a successful outcome.  It merely
ensures that specified controls are valid for a given mode, and
the values for those controls meet basic syntax requirements.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="compare_mask_baseline_snapshot_l_level" class="item"><strong>--compare</strong> <strong>mask</strong> <strong>{baseline|-}</strong> <strong>{snapshot|-}</strong> <strong>[-l level]</strong></a></strong></dt>

<p>Compare <strong>baseline</strong> and <strong>snapshot</strong> data according to the specified
<strong>mask</strong> where mask identifies the attributes to be analyzed.  Output
is written to stdout and has the following format:</p>
<pre>
    category|name|changed|unknown</pre>
<p>The category field indicates what type of change has occurred.  It
can have one of the following values:</p>
<pre>
    C - Changed
    M - Missing
    N - New
    U - Unknown (i.e., one or both fields were NULL)
    X - Cross (i.e., Changed and Unknown)</pre>
<p>The changed field contains a comma separated list of fields that
have changed.  This field will be NULL if the category is New or
Missing.</p>
<p>The unknown field contains a comma separated list of fields that
could not be compared due to lack of information.  This field will
be NULL if the category is New or Missing.</p>
<p>The specified <strong>mask</strong> must comply with the syntax rules set forth
for the <strong>FieldMask</strong> control.</p>
<p>Note: The <strong>baseline</strong> and <strong>snapshot</strong> arguments can not be '-'
simultaneously.</p>
<p>Note: Support for comparing compressed snapshots was added in version
3.6.0.</p>

<p>Decode a compressed <strong>snapshot</strong>.  A compressed snapshot can be
created by running <strong>FTimes</strong> in map mode (i.e., <strong>mapfull</strong> or

a set of user defined strings.  These strings are defined in <strong>file</strong>
according to the syntax for the <strong>DigStringNormal</strong>, <strong>DigStringNoCase</strong>,
and <strong>DigStringRegExp</strong> controls.  If <strong>list</strong> is not specified,
<strong>FTimes</strong> will search the entire system including remote shares or
mount points.  Any device files specifically included in the <strong>list</strong>
will be searched (i.e., <strong>AnalyzeDeviceFiles</strong> is always enabled in
this mode of operation).  Output is written to stdout and has the
following format.</p>
<pre>

three possible actions, depending on how getmode is configured,
will take place once the download is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> writes the downloaded information to stdout,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> writes the downloaded information to the file specified by <strong>GetFileName</strong>, or</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The first action is effected when <strong>GetAndExec</strong> is disabled and
<strong>GetFileName</strong> is not specified.  The second action is effected
when <strong>GetAndExec</strong> is disabled and <strong>GetFileName</strong> is specified.

files specifically included in the <strong>list</strong> will be mapped (i.e.,
<strong>AnalyzeDeviceFiles</strong> is always enabled in this mode of operation).
Output is written to stdout, and its format depends on the value

<h3><a name="configuration_controls">CONFIGURATION CONTROLS</a></h3>
<p>This section describes the various controls that <strong>FTimes</strong> recognizes.
In general, controls either shape runtime behavior or provide
information needed by the application to perform a specific function.
Controls and their values, one pair/line, are written to a file
having the following format.</p>
<pre>
    &lt;control&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</pre>
<p>All controls are case insensitive, but, in general, their values
are not.  Comments may occur anywhere on a given line, and must
begin with a pound character (i.e., '#').  In any given line, all
text to the right of the first comment will be ignored.  White
space surrounding controls and values is ignored.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="control_descriptions">CONTROL DESCRIPTIONS</a></h4>
<p>This section describes each control that may be specified, defines
what values it may have, and states which modes of operation

<p><strong>BaseName</strong> is required.  It specifies the name prefix that will
be attached to the various output files.  It also serves as the
CLIENTID parameter in GET/PING/PUT requests.  The recommended name
format is one that matches the following regular expression:</p>
<pre>
    ^[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}$</pre>
<p>This is because nph-ftimes.cgi uses that expression to validate the

enabled, but this is not a requirement.</p>
<p>If you're using FTimes in a lean mode, a good naming convention

both lean modes allow you to specify a <strong>BaseName</strong> value of '-'.

Otherwise, <strong>FTimes</strong> will abort.</p>
<p><strong>Include</strong> values must be a regular file, directory, or symbolic
link specified as a fully qualified path.  For WIN32 file systems,
this means that each <strong>Include</strong> must begin with a drive designator
([A-Za-z]:) and be followed by the target path (e.g., 'c:\temp').
For UNIX file systems, each <strong>Include</strong> must begin with a forward

<p>Note: Symbolic links are not supported in WIN32-based file systems.</p>
<p>Note: Take care when including file systems that reside on remote

<hr />
<h3><a name="notes">NOTES</a></h3>
<p>The name attribute may be partially encoded if it contains any
special characters.  Special characters are defined as <code>[`'&quot;|%+]</code>
or any non-printable character.  If a name contains Unicode
characters, the high byte is always encoded, and the low byte is
encoded as described above.  To decode an encoded name, first
convert all pluses to spaces (i.e., '+' -&gt; ' ').  Then, moving from
left to right, convert each %HH sequence, to its byte value.  Here
'H' denotes a hex digit.</p>
<p>As a matter of security and good configuration control, you should
create a baseline of your entire system on a periodic basis and
whenever major events occur such as the addition/removal of software
packages or the application of system/security patches.</p>
<p>In critical situations it is best to enable <strong>RequirePrivilege</strong>
and run <strong>FTimes</strong> from a privileged account.  This will avoid common
hang-ups associated with having too little privilege.  Backup and
restore rights are required to satisfy <strong>RequirePrivilege</strong> on NT
systems, and root privilege is required for UNIX systems.  If you
are simply scanning your own files, you probably do not need to
enable <strong>RequirePrivilege</strong>.  On NT systems the operator may need
the bypass traverse checking privilege in addition to backup and
restore rights.  Also, make sure that domain policies aren't
rendering the operator's privileges ineffective.</p>
<p>In general, use the default LogLevel and review the log data after
each invocation as it may reveal errors or issues that need to be
addressed.</p>
<p>In general, create distinct config files for each profile you intend
to maintain.  Here, profile refers to the set of files and directories
within a given host that you intend to scan on a regular basis.
If you have a large number of profiles that share a common set of
controls, you may want to move these controls to a single file.
Then, you may simply refer to this file using the <strong>Import</strong> control.</p>
<p>Set <strong>OutDir</strong> to a directory that has the capacity to hold all
resultant data.  If external media such as jaz, zip, or floppy are
available, consider using them.  However, using a floppy is not
generally recommended unless you know that it has the capacity to
hold the data.  You may also want to consider writing output to an
NFS, Samba, or Windows share.  A third option is to use <strong>FTimes'</strong>
built-in upload capability, and post your data directly to an
Integrity Server.</p>
<p>Setting <strong>LogDir</strong> to a path that represents a floppy device may be
useful if data integrity is a concern and there is no removable or
protectible media available to store all of the anticipated output.
The reason for this is that the log file will contain an MD5 digest
of the output file upon the completion of the map.  Because the
log data was written to floppy, it would be possible to remove and
write protect this information for safe keeping.  This would provide
additional time to offload the results of the map, which can be
quite large.  Obviously, both files can still be altered by a
skilled attacker positioned to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Manage dig and map config files on your Integrity Server, and
use <strong>FTimes'</strong> get mode (i.e., <strong>--getmode</strong>) to automatically retrieve
them at runtime.  This facilitates centralized management and helps
to protect potentially sensitive configuration information.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>URLPutSnapshot</strong>, <strong>URLPutURL</strong>, <strong>URLUsername</strong>, <strong>URLPassword</strong>,
and <strong>URLAuthType</strong> controls when you want to automatically upload
data to an Integrity Server that is configured to handle
<strong>FTimes'</strong> PUT requests.</p>
<p>If you have an SSL enabled version of <strong>FTimes</strong>, you'll need to
ensure that OpenSSL and/or its libraries are installed and accessible
to <strong>FTimes</strong> on the target platform.</p>
<p>When possible, mount target file systems as read only.  This will
help to ensure minimal time stamp perturbation.  In any event,
<strong>FTimes</strong> accurately records time stamp information before it is
modified by any subsequent access.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="examples">EXAMPLES</a></h3>
<p>The following examples are intended to demonstrate different ways
of configuring and using <strong>FTimes</strong>.  Any text encapsulated between
'--- XXX ---' delimiters represents a file's content.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="example_1__using_map_mode_to_baseline_and_upload">Example 1. Using map mode to baseline and upload</a></h4>
<p>This example demonstrates how to baseline a system and upload the
resulting snapshot to an Integrity Server.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be done is to obtain the necessary
upload information.  Assume that an Integrity Server has already
been configured to receive snapshots.  Also, assume that the
following information has been provided:</p>
<pre>
    URL = https://192.168.1.50:443/cgi-client/nph-ftimes.cgi
    Authentication Type = Basic
    Username/ClientID = client_1
    Password = password
    AllowedFieldMask = ALL-magic
    AllowedDataType = map
    Server Validates Client Certificates = N</pre>
<p>Observe that remote server speaks HTTPS.  Therefore, an SSL enabled
version of <strong>FTimes</strong> is needed.  To determine if <strong>FTimes</strong> has SSL
support, run the following command:</p>
<pre>
    ftimes --version</pre>
<p>If <strong>FTimes</strong> has SSL support, the output will have the following format:</p>
<pre>
    ftimes X.X.X ssl</pre>
<p>where X.X.X is a version number.</p>
<p>The next item to tackle is the creation of a suitable config file.
The following file contains the necessary directives to complete
this task.</p>
<pre>
    --- example1.cfg ---
    BaseName=client_1
    OutDir=.
    RunType=baseline
    FieldMask=ALL-magic
    URLPutSnapshot=Y
    URLPutURL=https://192.168.1.50:443/cgi-client/nph-ftimes.cgi
    URLAuthType=basic
    URLUsername=client_1
    URLPassword=password
    Compress=Y
    --- example1.cfg ---</pre>
<p>Note that there are no <strong>Include</strong> directives.  This omission causes
<strong>FTimes</strong> to map everything (i.e., the entire system).</p>
<p>Also, note that <strong>OutDir</strong> has been set to the current directory
(i.e., '.').  This, while entirely legal, assumes that (1) '.' is
writeable and (2) there is enough disk space to hold all generated
output.</p>
<p>Compression was enabled to expedite data transfer.</p>
<p>The last step is to run <strong>FTimes</strong> and review the corresponding log
output to ensure that snapshot was uploaded successfully.</p>
<pre>
    ftimes --mapfull example1.cfg</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="example_2__using_dig_mode_to_search_for_strings">Example 2. Using dig mode to search for strings</a></h4>
<p>This example demonstrates how to to search files and directories
for a set of HEX/ASCII and regular expression strings.</p>
<p>Given that the target file system is <code>/disk1</code>, and the list of
strings to to be sought are:</p>
<pre>
    String1 = /dev/ptyqa
    String2 = 0xda 0xbe
    String3 = 0x00 A 0x00 A 0x00 A 0x00 A
    String4 = A date of the form &lt;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&gt;
    String5 = Line oriented IP addresses of the form &lt;BOL|tab&gt;&lt;192.168.1.*&gt;&lt;tab|EOL&gt;</pre>
<p>where</p>
<pre>
    BOL = Beginning Of Line
    EOL = End Of Line</pre>
<p>Strings 1-3 are expressed as (ignore whitespace) ASCII, HEX, and
HEX/ASCII, respectively.  Strings 4 and 5, on the other hand, are
textual descriptions that must be translated into regular expressions.
Assume that the required <strong>MatchLimit</strong> is three.  That is to say,
no more than three matches per file of any single string should be
recorded.</p>
<p>The following config file contains those directives required to
search all files in /disk1.</p>
<pre>
    --- example2.cfg ---
    BaseName=digger
    OutDir=.
    MatchLimit=3
    DigStringNormal=/dev/ptyqa
    DigStringNormal=%da%be
    DigStringNoCase=%00A%00A%00A%00A
    DigStringRegExp=\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\x20\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}
    DigStringRegExp=(?m)(?:^|\t)(192\.168\.1\.\d{1,3})(?=\t|$)
    Include=/disk1
    --- example2.cfg ---</pre>
<p>Observe that strings two and three are URL encoded and that string
three will be processed in a case insensitive manner.  Read the
<strong>DigStringNormal</strong> control description for more details on URL
encoding.  Also notice that the fourth and fifth strings correspond
to Perl compatible regular expressions -- these types of dig strings
are available if you compiled <strong>FTimes</strong> with PCRE support.  With
<strong>DigStringRegExp</strong> patterns, however, you must specify no more than
one capturing '()' subpattern.  You can use '(?:)' if you require
additional parentheses for grouping purposes.  If you do not specify
a capturing subpattern, then the entire match will be captured.  In
this particular case, only the IP address will be captured. Also note
the use of '\x20' to represent a single space. This translation
necessary because dig strings may not contain embedded white space.</p>
<p>At this point <strong>FTimes</strong> may be run as follows:</p>
<pre>
    ftimes --diglean example2.cfg</pre>
<p>If spontaneity is desired over strict configuration, switch to the
<strong>digauto</strong> mode of operation.  In this mode elaborate config files
aren't necessary, and output is written to stdout.  Also, no match
limit is imposed.  The following example shows how to search an
image file (e.g., example2.image) for a set of specific strings.
The output, if any, can be piped into other tools that take their
input on stdin.</p>
<pre>
    --- strings.cfg ---
    DigStringNormal=This+box+is+0wn3d    attack_program
    DigStringNormal=3l33t                attack_program
    DigStringNormal=175.20.1.7           attack_ip
    DigStringNormal=hacklist@foo.bar.com
    --- strings.cfg ---</pre>
<pre>
    ftimes --digauto strings.cfg example2.image | some-other-tool</pre>
<p>Just remember that dig strings must be URL encoded with no embedded
white space. That's why the spaces in the first string have been
replaced with '+'.  Also, note that first three dig strings are
tagged.  In other words, each string has been assigned a value that
gives it a special meaning or identity.  Because the tag for first two
dig strings is the same, it can be used to classify both strings as
belonging to the same group.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="example_3__change_analysis">Example 3. Change analysis</a></h4>
<p>This example demonstrates how to detect change between two snapshots.</p>
<p>Given that the following files are valid, uncompressed snapshots:</p>
<pre>
    Baseline = daily_20001230203000.map
    Snapshot = daily_20001231203000.map</pre>
<p>Compare MD5 digests to determine (C)hanged, (M)issing, and (N)ew files.</p>
<p>The only critical observation needed here is that daily_20001230203000.map
is considered to be the baseline.  In other words, a baseline is
a snapshot taken at an arbitrary point in time to which subsequent
snapshots are compared.</p>
<p>This comparison is carried out with the following command:</p>
<pre>
    ftimes --compare none+md5 daily_20001230203000.map daily_20001231203000.map</pre>
<p>To compare multiple attributes at the same time, simply specify the
additional fields in the <strong>FieldMask</strong>. For example, the following mask
would compare MD5, SHA1, and size attributes:</p>
<pre>
    none+md5+sha1+size</pre>
<p>To compare all attributes at the same time, use a <strong>FieldMask</strong> of
'all'.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><a name="example_4__using_get_mode_to_download_a_config_file">Example 4. Using get mode to download a config file</a></h4>
<p>This example demonstrates how to download a config file from an
Integrity Server.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be done is to obtain the necessary
download information.  Assume that an Integrity Server has
already been configured to serve config files.  Also, assume that
the following information has been provided:</p>
<pre>
    URL = https://www.integrity.net:443/cgi-client/nph-ftimes.cgi
    Authentication Type = Basic
    Username/ClientID = client_1
    Password = password
    Server Validates Client Certificates = Y
    Server Common Name = www.integrity.net
    Maximum Certificate Chain Length = 2</pre>
<p>Observe that remote server requires certificates.  This means that
you'll need three additional PEM encoded files: Public Certificate,
Private Key, and Bundled Certificate Authorities.  Assume that
these files are located on the target system as follows:</p>
<pre>
    /usr/local/ftimes/etc/PublicCert.pem
    /usr/local/ftimes/etc/PrivateKey.pem
    /usr/local/ftimes/etc/BundledCAs.pem</pre>
<p>Armed with that information, the following config file may be
constructed.</p>
<pre>
    --- example5.cfg ---
    BaseName=client_1
    URLGetURL=https://www.integrity.net:443/cgi-client/nph-ftimes.cgi
    URLGetRequest=MapFullConfig
    GetAndExec=N
    URLAuthType=basic

<p>The following command will attempt to download a mapfull config
file from the specified Integrity Server.  If successful, the
contents of the config file will be written to stdout.</p>
<pre>
    ftimes --getmode example5.cfg</pre>
<p>If you want to download directly to a file, you can redirect the
output to a file or add the <strong>GetFileName</strong> control to your config
file.  Then, if you wanted to download a config file and take a
snapshot in one operation, simply enable <strong>GetAndExec</strong>.  This causes
<strong>FTimes</strong> to restart in <strong>--mapfull</strong> mode.  If <strong>URLGetRequest</strong> was
set to DigFullConfig, then <strong>FTimes</strong> would request a digfull config
file and subsequently restart in <strong>--digfull</strong> mode.</p>
<p>Another way to achieve the same effect is to use the original config
file and construct the following pipeline:</p>
<pre>
    ftimes --getmode example5.cfg -l 6 | ftimes --mapfull -</pre>
<p>This has the benefit that potentially sensitive configuration
information is not specifically written to a file on disk.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the <strong>LogLevel</strong> for the first command was set
to its highest value.  This was done simply to reduce log output
from that process.</p>

<p>The official or given name of this utility is <strong>FTimes</strong>, but
operationally it is referred to as <strong>ftimes</strong>.  In the fledgling
stages of development, the name <strong>FTimes</strong> was short for <strong>F</strong>ile
<strong>Times</strong>.  This was because its primary purpose was to collect
timestamp information from systems suspected of having been
compromised.</p>
<p>The first version of <strong>FTimes</strong> was written in the Spring of 1998
to support a forensic examination of a compromised system.  At that
time, <strong>FTimes</strong> was primarily a workbench tool for the forensic
practitioner.  As time passed, its audience expanded to include
system administrators and computer security professionals who needed
tools to monitor the integrity of their systems.  Eventually, it
became a core component in Exodus' Content Integrity Monitoring
Service (CIMS).</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2001, Exodus Communications, Inc. approved my request
to make <strong>FTimes</strong> Open Source.  At that time version two was very
stable, but I was in the throws of creating version three which
was a major restructuring of the code base.  Consequently, I decided
to wait until the new version was complete before releasing it to
the community.</p>
<p>On January 29, 2002, the first Open Source version of FTimes was
released from SourceForge.</p>
<p><strong>FTimes</strong> continues to support the workbench environment, but has
evolved into a tool that can be utilized to support Integrity
Monitoring in large, diverse, and distributed environments.  Today,
<strong>FTimes</strong> more appropriately equates to <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>T</strong>opography and
<strong>I</strong>ntegrity <strong>M</strong>onitoring on an <strong>E</strong>nterprise <strong>S</strong>cale.</p>
<p>The original design objectives for <strong>FTimes</strong> were to build a tool that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>does one thing extremely well (i.e., collect file attributes),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>utilizes a simple, effective, and well understood algorithm that can be applied equally well to different operating systems,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>generates output that is easily assimilated by a wide variety of existing tools,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has built-in logging that is complete, precise, and useful for analysis purposes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is accurate, efficient, and minimally invasive,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doesn't need to be &quot;installed&quot; on a given system to work on that system,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is small enough to run from floppy even if statically compiled, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides only a command line interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
