        Breaking and Decoding Tools</b> 
     
      </p><p>The following 
        codes and ciphers are detailed below, click to go straight to one or carry

      </p><p>Creating and 
        decoding secret messages has played a pivotal role throughout history 
        and in many fictional novels, from the Caesar Cipher by Julias Caesar, 
        through to the Enigma Machine in World War II to the various codes in 
        Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code. 
      </p><p>Detailed below 
        are various decoding tools, starting with the simplest and progressing 
        to the increasingly complicated. In The Da Vinci Game, several of the 
        Logic Key challenges use simple variants of these codes which can be deciphered 
        manually. They are provided here simply for your enjoyment. 
      </p><p>For more information 
        about The Da Vinci Board Game itself, please see the links on the left. 
      </p><p><b><a name="Codes" id="Codes"></a>Modern 
        Codes</b>

      </p><p>The invention 
        of the computer  along with the development of modern Internet connection media such as <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/">broadband</a>, has meant that modern codes  are immeasurably more complicated 
        than the codes described below, with the possibility to transform a message 
        in innumerable ways. The Enigma machine used in World War II is probably 
        the earliest example of this. </p>
      <p>Even with this 
        encryption the challenge is still to pass on the decoding mechanism or 
        key to the intended recipient of messages in a way in which it cannot 
        be intercepted, as if the key falls into someone else's hands, then you 
        may as well be writing your code in plain English.      </p>
      <p><b><a name="Atbash"></a>Atbash 
        Cipher </b> 
      </p><p>The Atbash 
        Cipher is a simple substition cipher where the first letter of the alphabet 
        is exchanged with the last letter of the alphabet and so on. It is the 
        simplest cipher because it only allows one possible way to decode a word. 
        That said, the cipher will vary depending on the alphabet; for the English 
        alphabet simply exchange the letter in the code for the letter either 
        below or above it in the following table: 
      </p><p><img src="Code_breaking_files/Atbash_cipher.JPG" alt="Atbash Cipher, used in The Bible and The Da Vinci Code" height="84" width="490"> 
      </p><p> <b>Q1.</b> 
        Using the Atbash cipher, what does the code YRYOV become? (a book that 
        contains several words coded using this cipher). 
      </p><p><b><a name="Caesar"></a>Caesar 
        Shift Decoder (also called the Caesar Cipher)</b> 
      </p><p>The Caesar 
        Shift allows you to encode text in one of 25 different ways, by shifting 
        each letter between 1 and 25 'steps' along the alphabet, so a shift of 
        1 would mean A becomes B, B becomes C, etc. To download a free copy of 
        a <a href="http://www.thedavincigame.com/Boardgame/Caesar_code_solver.xls"><b>Caesar Shift Decoder</b></a> 
        which allows you to see all 25 possible Caesar Shifts simultaneously, 
        please click <a href="http://www.thedavincigame.com/Boardgame/Caesar_code_solver.xls"><b>here</b></a>. 
        You will need Microsoft Excel to view and use the attachment. 
      </p><p>The Caesar 
        Shift or Caesar Cipher can be made more complicated by having a different 
        shift for different letters in the sequence, as in the recent code that 
        Judge Peter Smith hid in the document of this judgement in The Da Vinci 
        Code vs. Holy Blood, Holy Grail case. 
      </p><p><b>Q2.</b> 
        Using the Caesar Cipher, what does the code P BOO WK CYX become? (indicating 
        an affiliation with a certain secret society). <br>
        <br>
      </p><p><b><a name="Square"></a>Caesar 
        Square or Box</b> 
      </p><p>The Caesar 
        Square requires the decoder to omit any spaces and then rewrite the code 
        in a square and read down the columns to reveal the answer, so for example 
        to encode the phrase 'What an unusual box', first omit the spaces to get 
        'WHATANUNUSUALBOX' and then write them in a box as follows: 
      </p><p><img src="Code_breaking_files/Caesar_square_box.JPG" alt="The Caesar Square or Caesar Box" height="139" width="213"><br>
        <br>
        To write this in code, you would then print 'WA ULH NS BA UU OT NAX' (the 
        spaces are unimportant). 
      </p><p>While it would 
        be possible to use a rectangle instead of a square, a square is the standard 
        mechanism for this particular encoding device, therefore if the number 
        of letters in a code is a square number (9, 16, 25, 36, etc.) it may indicate 
        a Caesar Square is being used. 
      </p><p><b>Q3.</b> 
        Using the Caesar Square, what phrase is revealed here: 'CAE EG ELLNE NIL 
        CNT NI ECRT GAY' (an organisation who spend plenty of time cracking codes 
        themselves). 
      </p><p><b><a name="Anagrams"></a>Anagrams</b> 
      </p><p>Anagrams are 
        where the order of letters is rearranged to form a new word or phrase, 
        so EARTH can become HEART and SECURE can become RESCUE. 
      </p><p>The longer 
        the anagram the more difficult a code is to solve, some codes can be set 
        where a standard algorithm to change the place of letters is used (e.g. 
        the first and seventh letters are swapped, the second and forth letters 
        are swapped, etc.) To create the Vitruvian Man clues in The Da Vinci Game, 
        we used <a href="http://www.anagramgenius.com/ag.html"><b>Anagram Genius</b></a> 
        (TM) which orders anagrams into the most likely and most interesting first 
        and was also used by Dan Brown to generate the Anagrams used in The Da 
        Vinci Code. 
      </p><p><b>Q4.</b> 
        What city is 'GNASH ON WIT' an anagram of? 
      </p><p><b><a name="Substitution"></a>Other 
        Substitution Ciphers</b> 
      </p><p>A more complex 
        substitution cipher is where letters are replaced with other letters at 
        random, so A might become Y, B could become D, etc. It's practically impossible 
        to crack short codes written using this, unless you discover the key, 
        however for longer codes frequency analysis can be used, whereby you count 
        how many times each letter appears in the code and compare this to the 
        frequency of how commonly different letters normally appear in the alphabet. 
      </p><p>For example, 
        if the letter 'Q' appears the most often in a code, it will probably be 
        a common letter, such as 'E', 'T' or 'A'. The following graph shows how 
        frequently different letters crop up in the English language, courtesy 
        of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis">Wikipedia</a>: 
      </p><p><img src="Code_breaking_files/Frequency_Analysis.png" alt="Frequency Analysis Decoding Tool" height="273" width="340"> 
      </p><p>A clever coded 
        message will hide the frequency by carefully using, for example few words 
        that include the letter E in the message to be decoded. Some codes also 
        use punctuation, numbers and even spaces as part of the code and also 
        deliberate mis-spellings to make it more difficult for the solver. There 
        is a program to encode your own substitution ciphers <a href="http://blogger-bee.com/virtualsoil/CGI/anycode.html">here</a>.
      </p><p><b>Q5. </b>Can 
        you decode the quote from the play Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare:
      </p><p> "Juemrn 
        rby heiw obhyn nypjmy oaybm ryeoan; ay segbeio iysym oenoy jp ryeoa nqo 
        jicy.<br>
        P egg oay ujirymn oaeo wyo aesy ayemr, bo nyyhn oj hy hjno nomeity oaeo 
        hyi najqgr pyem;<br>
        yybit oaeo ryeoa, e iycynnemw yir, ubgg cjhy uayi bo ubgg cjhy."
      </p><p><b><a name="Ciphers"></a>Other 
        ciphers</b>
      </p><p>In addition 
        to the ciphers above there are many other ways to code messages and the 
        most difficult codes will use a range of different encryption methods, 
        such as applying a sustitution cipher and then rearranging the letters 
        using a Caesar Square or some other method.
      </p><p>Another way 
        to hide codes is to hide them in plain sight, where for example the fifth 
        letter in every paragraph makes a code, or a grid is placed over text 
        with small holes in it and only the letters you can see through the holes 
        are read. This means that a passage of text is unlikely to be recognised 
        as a code so an attempt to decode it is less likely.
