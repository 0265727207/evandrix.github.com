<p class="Title">
 Cryptanalysis of the Vigenere cipher
</p>



<p class="Text"> The Vigenere cipher is probably the most commonly
known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, attributed (incorrectly) to
Blaise de Vigenere in the 16th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been used and
regarded as being "practically unbreakable" as late as World War I, in
spite of knowledge of a general solution since at least the mid 1850s.
</p>



<p class="Text"> The Vigenere cipher is interesting not because it has
been broken, but because its solution involved, or at least stimulated,
the first systematic application of statistical methods to
cryptanalysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief description of these methods is
presented, including a <a href="#applet">Java applet</a> (with <span><a title="/erfarmer201/downloads/Vigenere.zip" href="http://home.comcast.net/erfarmer201/downloads/Vigenere.zip"><span class="HyperlinkInline">source code</span></a></span>) which automates the solution of a Vigenere cipher.
</p>



<p class="Section 1">
 Frequency analysis
</p>



<p class="Text">
 A <span style="font-style: italic;">monoalphabetic</span>
cipher is a simple substitution, as in the cryptograms in a daily
newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each occurrence of a particular letter is
replaced by another throughout the message, so that, for example,
plaintext 'a' becomes ciphertext 'K', 'b' becomes 'S',
etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;(The convention of using lowercase for plaintext and
uppercase for ciphertext will be used throughout.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution
of a monoalphabetic cipher typically begins by guessing the assignments
of some ciphertext letters based on their frequency of occurrence in
the message.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is possible due to the non-uniform
distribution of letters in language, specifically English (used in the
examples throughout).&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the letter 'e' is by far the
most frequently occurring letter in English text (see the chart below),
it is reasonable to guess that the most frequently occurring <span style="font-style: italic;">ciphertext</span> letter is assigned to plaintext 'e'.

<p class="Text">
 A <span style="font-style: italic;">polyalphabetic</span>
cipher is more complex in that a particular plaintext letter is not
always replaced by the same ciphertext letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigenere
cipher is a special case of a periodic polyalphabetic cipher, and works
as follows.&nbsp;&nbsp;A message is encrypted using a keyword; imagine
writing the keyword repeatedly underneath and alongside the message,
and "shifting" each plaintext letter in the alphabet according to the
corresponding key letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;If letters are represented by
integers modulo 26, then this encryption scheme is given by <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span> = <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span> (mod 26), where <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span> are letters of the ciphertext, plaintext and key, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:
</p>



<p class="Program">
 <br>plaintext&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thatwasthecuriousincident<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blazeblazeblazeblazeblaze<br>-------------------------------------<br>ciphertext&nbsp;&nbsp;USASABDTGIDFRHSVDIMGJOEMX<br>
</p>



<p class="Text"> Note that plaintext 't' is assigned to several
different ciphertext letters ('U', 'S', 'T' and 'X').&nbsp;&nbsp;The
effect is to "flatten" the distribution of ciphertext letter
frequencies, making them appear more random; the longer the keyword,
the more uniform the resulting distribution tends to be, providing less
information for the cryptanalyst.
</p>



<p class="Section">
 Index of coincidence
</p>



<p class="Text"> Recall the 5-letter keyword from the previous
example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the 1st, 6th, 11th, etc., letters of the
message is encrypted using the same key letter 'b'.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,
they are encrypted using a simple monoalphabetic substitution, and so
the corresponding frequency distribution for those letters should
resemble that shown above.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to the subset of
message letters encrypted by each of the other 4 key letters.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 More generally, if <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> is the keyword length, then each of the <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>
blocks of equally-spaced ciphertext letters should have a frequency
distribution that is not random, but resembling that for English
text.&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggests that the cryptanalyst may try all
possible keyword lengths, selecting the value for which each of the
resulting ciphertext blocks is sufficiently non-random.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 The key observation is that "sufficiently non-random" is a measurable quality, using a metric called the <span style="font-style: italic;">index of coincidence</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is defined to be the probability that two randomly selected letters
will be identical, but it is effectively a measure of "distance" from
the uniform distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;For completely random text, this
probability is about 0.038.&nbsp;&nbsp;For English text (or
monoalphabetically encrypted English text), it is about 0.065.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 In addition to finding the <span style="font-style: italic;">length</span>
of the keyword, a variant of the index of coincidence may also be used
to determine the actual letters of the keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">mutual index of coincidence</span>
for two blocks of text is the probability that two randomly selected
letters, one from each block, will be identical.&nbsp;&nbsp;The utility
of this metric is based on the following claim: if two blocks of
ciphertext are encrypted with the same key letter, the mutual index of
coincidence of the blocks will be significantly greater than if they
are encrypted with two different key letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;By
successively "shifting" the letters in one of the blocks (or
equivalently, repeatedly encrypting with key 'b'), and noting the shift
which results in the greatest mutual index of coincidence, the
relationship between the two corresponding key letters may be
determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;By examining all pairs of ciphertext blocks, the
key letters may almost be derived directly.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 "Almost," because only the relationships <span style="font-style: italic;">between</span>
key letters may be derived this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a known
particular key letter, there are still 26 possible cyclic shifts of the
actual keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, simple monoalphabetic frequency
analysis on each ciphertext block may "lock" the keyword into one of
those possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if 'F' is by far the most
frequently occurring ciphertext letter in a particular block, this
suggests that 'F' is assigned to plaintext 'e', or equivalently, that
the corresponding key letter is 'b' ('F' "minus" 'e').

 <a name="applet">Automatic cryptanalysis</a>
</p>



<p class="Text"> Use the Java applet below to experiment with the
Vigenere encryption and decryption process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paste a
selection of plaintext or ciphertext into the text area, enter a
keyword in the indicated field, and press the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt"
button as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that spaces, punctuation, etc.,
will be automatically stripped off.
</p>



<p class="Text"> More interesting is the "Guess key"
button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paste a selection of Vigenere-encrypted ciphertext
into the text area (for convenience, a sample is included below), and
press "Guess key."&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate of the keyword is given based
on the combination of index of coincidence tests and frequency analysis
described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;Press "Decrypt" to see the resulting
plaintext.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the program is not perfect, but its
accuracy improves with longer ciphertext (see the performance analysis
in the next section).&nbsp;&nbsp;As a guide, a selection of text that
fills the entire text area is usually enough.

<p class="Section">
 Algorithm performance
</p>



<p class="Text"> For a given ciphertext, the algorithm implemented in
the Java applet involves several computational steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
the length of the keyword is estimated based on the index of
coincidence test.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the relationships between keyletters
are computed using mutual indices of coincidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a
particular cyclic shift of the keyword is selected based on frequency
analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;At each step, a <span style="font-style: italic;">single</span>
choice is made on the path of decisions that leads to a single estimate
of the keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp;This single guess is not always accurate, as
the following chart shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability of successful
decryption was estimated by bootstrapping 1000 random keywords and
random plaintext selections of the appropriate length from "The Hound
of the Baskervilles" (a total of about 250,000
characters).&nbsp;&nbsp;As should be expected, the cryptanalysis is
made more difficult by shorter ciphertext and/or a longer keyword.
