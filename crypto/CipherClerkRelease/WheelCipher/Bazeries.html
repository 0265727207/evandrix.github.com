<p>This is a simulation of Major Bazeries cipher device. The applet is the 
  same as for the M-94, so there is no difference ion using it. I merly didn't 
  want to locate the device under the description of the US M-94. Nor did 
I  want to change the user interface so that switching between M-94 and Bazeries 
  setup can be done at runtime. Please note that the letter W is not avaliable. 
  This is not a bug in the simulator, it's a feature of the <i>original</i> 
  device: For the frenchman Bazeries, this letter was dispensible. To encrypt 
  a W, replace it by two V's: VV looks quite like W, doesn't it? The decission 
  to drop W is offcourse based on statistical properties of the french language 
  where - in contrast to english - J is more frequently used than K. <br>
     The device has less disks than the M-94 and the alphabets are not so 
well   mixed as those of the M-94. For this reasons, it is less secure. The 
lack   of security was not just hypotethical: The french cryptographer <i>deViaries</i>
   found an attack that demolished the security of Major Bazeries cipher
completely.    </p>

      The data for the simulation was taken from <i>Decrypted Secrets : Methods
   and Maxims of Cryptology</i> by Friedrich L. Bauer. For a description
of   the simulator, please refer to the <a href="VirtualM94.html">U.S. version</a>
   of the device.

<p>Khan's book is <i>the</i> book on the history of cryptography. Bauer's
   book is pretty good as well: It's much shorter, but more mathemathical
and  technical. Nevertheless it should be readable to almost everyone. I
strongly  recommend both! (Provided that you're interested in crypto, offcourse!)
