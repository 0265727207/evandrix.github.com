<p>Please expect a delay of a few minutes to load the applet. If you are
unfamiliar with CipherClerk's Applet, please read the online documentation:

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Netscape 3.0 + Windows NT 4.0 doesn't work for me. Netscape
 3.0 GOLD does work fine, as well as Netscape 4.0, M$ Internet Explorer 3, 
Sun's and M$'s Java SDK's. I've read that IE 4.0 is <i>not fully </i>compatible
 to Java. <br>
 M$ Internet Explorer 3 doesn't display a scroll bar for choices. Since the 
choice for the ciphers is longer then the available area you will neither
 see all ciphers nor any hint that there are more than shown. Nevertheless
 you can scroll using arrow up/down! </p>
