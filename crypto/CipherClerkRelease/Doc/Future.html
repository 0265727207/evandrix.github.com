<h2>
Compatibility Issues:</h2>
I've tested CipherClerk's Applet with the following browsers: Netscape
Namvigator 4.7, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0, and Opera 4.02. Additionally,
I've tested it using Sun's Appletviewer in JDK 1.3. Finally, I testet the
code as Java Application using Microsoft's Java VM and the VM's from Sun's
JDK 1.3 and 1.1.8. All these test where done on Microsoft Windows.
<br>Unfortunately I neither own different harware nor do I have a Linux
/ Unix box handy. The rest <i>should</i> be a matter of compatibility amonge
the Java Virtual Machines. So while CipherClerk's Applet <i>should</i>
run everywhere, but you <i>might</i> experiance unexpected behaviour, too.

<h3>
Bugs &amp; Changes:</h3>
Version 1.3b2
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug that caused CipherClerk's Applet to crash within the Opera&nbsp;
browser whenever the page it's been loaded from was re-visited.</li>

<li>
As I use CipherClerk as my nom-de-chiffre, the applet is now refered as
<i>CipherClerk's
Applet</i>.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.2b1
<ul>
<li>
A second - reduced version distilled. Contains only a few ciphers, takes
only half space. To be uses only if I run out of space on my home page.</li>

<li>
For the full version, the selection of the cipher to be used was split
into two parts.</li>

<li>
Some ciphers added: Gronsfeld, GROMARK, T52.</li>

<li>
Fixed a zillion typos, but left enough if you enjoy searching....</li>

<li>
some other minor changes.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.1b2
<ul>
<li>
More cipher machines added: Hagelin C-35, C-38; Kryha; Hebern; RED &amp;
PURPLE machine.</li>

<li>
Simple Substitution: ability to mix both alphabets.</li>

<li>
Help message added.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.1b1
<ul>
<li>
User Interface modified: Cipher and operation are now chosen at the text
input.</li>

<li>
A simulation of the B211 cipher machine added.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.0b13
<ul>
<li>
Some minor changes.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.0b11
<ul>
<li>
Some minor GUI changes</li>

<li>
The input text is optionally copied to the result.</li>

<li>
Output setup is now conserved while the applet is running.</li>

<li>
Nihilist substitution may now use 0-4 or 1-5 as row &amp; column labels.</li>

<li>
Polyalphabetic Substitution, Nihilist substitution, Bifid and Two square:
Smart use of the second (and third) key word: The clear button now turns
off the use of the key word. When entering these key words, pressing the
enter key will turn on the use of the key word if it is acceptable.</li>

<li>
CipherClerk didn't load from aprox. 15 to 29 August.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.0b10
<ul>
<li>
Morse Code Based Ciphers added: Pollux, Morbit, Fractionated Morse</li>

<li>
Added plain text/cipher text based interruption to polyalphabetic substitution</li>

<li>
Choice of <i>complete </i>/ <i>irregular </i>transposition changed to radio
buttons.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.0b9
<ul>
<li>
Introducing a new 36 letter alphabet.</li>

<li>
Nihilist substitution completed.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.0b8
<ul>
<li>
Nihilist substitution added. Note that this cipher is <i>not </i>implemented
and described <i>completely</i>: So far, only the use of checkerboard is
done. The final addition using a second key will be done soon, hopefully!</li>

<li>
Append Cipher Info is now on by default.</li>

<li>
ACA Homophonic cipher added</li>

<li>
Whetstone cipher added</li>

<li>
Redfence cipher added</li>

Different key words for plain text and cipher text alphabets for polyalphabetic
substitution cipher.</li>
</ul>
Version 1.0b7
<ul>
<li>
New feature. Playfair cipher separates double letters by nulls.</li>

<li>
Bug fixed. Playfair cipher: if letters are found in the same row or column,

<h2>
Still to come:</h2>
I haven't added features for some time. At present I think CipherClerk's
applet is pretty finished. I consider a rewrite into a Swing-based application,
but due to lack of time I don't know if I'll ever start working on this.
<br>At present I spend more time by having fun with solving cryptogramms
and try to write some helpfull software. If I find that I've got something
usefull, I'll publish it on the net.
