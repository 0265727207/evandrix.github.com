Description</H3>
This is not really a paper and pencil cipher, it is one of the simplest
cipher machines. It uses a watch-like setup: A long hand pointing towards
the plain text alphabet and a short hand pointing towards the cipher text
alphabet. The plaintext alphabet consists of the 26 letters A-Z in the
normal alphabetic order preceded by a word separator. The cipher text alphabet
consists of the 26 letters A-Z, unordered and without additional word separator.
The long and the short hand are connected by a 27/26 gear, so that moving
one pointer by one character moves the other by one character as well.

<P>To encipher, the long hand is moved clockwise until it points to the
character to be enciphered and it's cipher text substitution is obtained
from the position of the short hand. At the end of a word, the long hand
is moved clockwise to the word separator and the character at the position
of the short hand is written down, too. Thus this cipher conserves the
word spacing.

<P>Note that the cipher can't encrypt double letters: They must either
be omitted, separated a null or the second must replace by a null.

<P>When using this cipher, you need to know the (mixed) cipher text alphabet
and the initial positions of the pointers. Within CipherClerk's Applet's implementation,
you specify the the cipher text alphabet by a key word and an algorithm
how to generate the mixed alphabet (see how a <A HREF="MixedAlphabet.html">substitution
is generated</A>), while the two hands point to the first letters of the
alphabet.
