<h3> What CipherClerk's Applet Is <i>NOT</i></h3>
       CipherClerk's Applet is not a tool to protect information. The ciphers 
  implemented in this package do not provide secrecy any more! They are more 
  or less outdated. They can be broken, e. g. the original message can be 
reconstructed  without knowing the keyword, even without the knowledge which 
cipher was used! Thus you should not use them to protect vital or valuable 
information. This packages is intended for amusement, not for security! If 
you search security, go for PGP - a free, state-of-the art cryptography package 
available for virtually all computer systems.       
<h3> So What Is CipherClerk's Applet?</h3>
       CipherClerk is an applet implementing a collection of historic ciphers. 
  Most ciphers are "paper &amp; pencil" types, e. g. to use them you wouldn't 
  need more than a sheet of paper and something to write.       
<p>You'll find various historic cipher systems, both substitution and transposition 
   types. If you've know about Vigenere, Porta, Beaufort, Bifid, and Playfair: 
   they are all available! </p>
           
<p>Finally, there are some machine ciphers of the WWII era, too. </p>

<h3> Legal Stuff</h3>
       ChiperClerk's Applet is <i>not</i> in public domain. It is copyrighted, 
  but you may use it <i>freely</i>. I tested this package carefully and found 
  no problems. I think it should not cause any damage to you system. Furthermore, 
   the Java environment in your web browser is claimed to provide enough security
   to protect you from possible damage. Nevertheless it is provided "as is"
  without express or implied warranty:

<h3> Virtual US Army Cipher Device, Model M-94</h3>
       I wrote another crypto applet / application for simulation the <a
 href="VirtualM94.html">US Army wheel cipher M-94</a> and <a
 href="Bazeries.html">Maior Bazeries cipher</a> device. It does provide much
   of the look &amp; feel of the original device. Since it is not as huge
as   CipherClerk, it should load mush faster, too. <br>

<hr width="100%">       
<p>To proceed, you may </p>
           
<ul>
       <li> read about <a href="Doc/Introduction.html">Cryptography</a>,
if  you  have no or little knowledge about this.</li>
        <li> read how to use <a href="Doc/UsingCipherClerk.html">CipherClerk's
   Applet</a>, if you don't know about it.</li>
        <li> see <a href="Doc/CipherList.html">which ciphers are available</a>
   within CipherClerk's Applet.</li>
        <li> read about <a href="Doc/Future.html">things to come and known
 bugs</a>.</li>
        <li> you may start the <font size="+1"><a
 href="CipherClerk.html">CipherClerk's  applet</a>.</font></li>
        <br>
      Expect a delay of a few minutes to load the applet: It consists of
aprox.      <i>seventy </i>class files with a total size of <i>300 KB</i>.
There is   a .zip file containing all classes so that a browser can load
one file instead   of many. All maior current browsers should take advantage
of this archive.     <li> finally, you may download <a
 href="http://members.aon.at/cipherclerk/CipherClerkRelease.zip">CipherClerk's 
   Applet</a> for off-line usage (aprox. 900KB). The files contains a compressed 
   copy of the whole site. Expand the zip'ed stuff into any folder you like 
  and then open one of the HTML files with a browser capable of using Java 
 Applets.</li>
