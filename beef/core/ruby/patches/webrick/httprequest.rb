# The following file contains patches for WEBrick.
module WEBrick
  
  class HTTPRequest
    
    # I'm patching the HTTPRequest class so that it when it receives POST
    # http requests, it parses the query present in the body even if the
    # content type is not set.
    #
    # The reason for this patch is that when a zombie sends back data to
    # BeEF, that data was not parsed because by default the content-type
    # was not set directly. I prefer patching WEBrick rather than editing
    # the BeEFJS library because cross domain http requests would be harder
    # to implement at the server level.
    #
    # Note: this function would need to be modified if we ever needed to
    # use multipart POST requests.
