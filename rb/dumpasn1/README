Version 0.1 03-09-2008

This basic version takes input of cert.pem.

Just copy your PEM encoded base64 certificate to here and run:

ruby asn1.rb

Requires ruby-termios-0.9.5 to run.

TODO:
1. Tidy up code so that results look more like Dumpasn1 output
2. More work on encapsulation - its still flaky!
3. More testing!!!
