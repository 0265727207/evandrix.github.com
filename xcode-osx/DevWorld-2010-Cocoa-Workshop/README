Example code from the DevWorld 2010 Pre-Conference Cocoa Workshop

I have split each example up into separate branches:

- FirstCmdLine
  A very simple command line application.
- Contacts
  Simple contacts app.
- ContactsApp
  The same contacts app, ported to iOS.
- Touch
  Demonstration that logs touch events to the console.
- Graphics
  Demonstration of graphics and mouse events.
